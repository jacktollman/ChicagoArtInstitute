Toulouse-Lautrec lived and worked in Montmartre, a bohemian neighborhood at the northern frontier of Paris, from 1886 to 1898. Like the Moulin Rouge dance hall and the Chat Noir café, the Cirque Fernando was a fixture of Montmartre’s seedy entertainment scene and a favorite haunt of the artist. Here he portrayed an equestrian performer at the circus; with rouged cheeks and a scant skirt, she charges into the composition, riding bareback and clutching her horse’s mane. Leaving much of the cardboard support bare, the artist laid in his composition with bold, rapid strokes of pastel, reserving more careful work in wet peinture à l’essence for the rider’s costume and enigmatic expression.

The performer sits sidesaddle, preparing to execute a spectacular stunt—to stand on a horse as it gallops around the ring, and dive through a paper hoop. We feel the excitement and anticipation as she speeds around the arena, her face isolated against the sweeping background. In the stands, a single top-hatted observer looks on, emerging almost grotesquely from a sea of blurred, vibrating motion.
